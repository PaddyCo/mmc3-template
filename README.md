# MMC3 Template

This is a minimal boilerplate project for making NES roms using the
[MMC3](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC3) mapper with CA65

This is mostly for my personal use, and may not be exactly what you are looking for,
but feel free to make use of it if you want!

## Special Thanks

[nesdoug](https://github.com/nesdoug) for some of the MMC3 stuff
